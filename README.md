# crt_deck

This app is specifically meant for switching between the normal default Steam deck resolution and 480p and is to be used for games and apps that can work in a window, along side KWin rules.

I use this with my 15kHz Sony PVM monitor.

Pull requests are welcome.

As this software is totally open source you can, swap out the resolutions with whatever you want.


## Usage:
```
chmod +x crt_deck
./crt_deck
```
